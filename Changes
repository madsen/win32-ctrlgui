        - Added more debug_print statements to State hierarchy.
        - Refactored code in State::seq hierarchy
        - Refactored lots of code in the State hierarchy to create multi
          abstract parent class
        - Discovered overload fallback => 1 !!!!!
        - Rewrote loop support syntax (important, important)
        - Added completely new (and, I believe, superior) syntax option for
          all multi subclasses

0.20  Mon Jun 18 2001
        - Added code to Win32::CtrlGUI::Window to verify that the window
          still exists before doing things (like sending keystrokes).
        - Total, total refactor of the multi hierarchy.  bookkeeper implemented.
        - Tk debugger for Win32::CtrlGUI::State written.  The killer app for
          Win32::CtrlGUI::State now exists.  It still needs some work, but it's
          functional enough to be of use.
